Initial commit: Unity 6 Falling Sand v1.0

Complete port from Java/libGDX to Unity 6 with C#.

Features:
- 30+ element types with cellular automata mechanics
- Movable solids: Sand, Dirt, Snow, Gunpowder, Coal, Ember
- Immovable solids: Stone, Brick, Wood, Ground, Titanium, Slime Mold
- Liquids: Water, Oil, Acid, Lava, Blood, Cement
- Gases: Steam, Smoke, Spark, Explosion Spark, Flammable Gas
- Fire & heat propagation system
- Chemical reactions (acid corrosion, water cooling, etc.)
- Explosion mechanics with radial blast
- Chunk-based spatial partitioning for optimization
- Physics integration (Marching Squares + Douglas-Peucker)
- Texture2D CPU-based rendering
- 60+ FPS performance with optimizations

Technical:
- Architecture: Modular OOP with clear inheritance hierarchies
- Performance: Frame modulation, enum comparisons, batch rendering
- Documentation: Comprehensive guides for designers and coders
- Element CA rules documented in plain English + pseudocode
